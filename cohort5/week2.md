# Week 2

## Summary

Researching on performance optimization projects around revm, and thinking about how to do detailed inner latency testing on revm and how to fully testing a evm vm.

## Attend Meetings

* EPF office hour, about ethereum security.
* Attend Chinese EPF meeting, about EOF introduction.

## Weekly Updates

* Read [Alloy 0.1 Release](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/06/alloy-release)
* Read [Alloy Book](https://alloy.rs/)
* Read [EPF.wiki Week4 | Testing and Security](https://epf.wiki/#/eps/week4)
* Review and testing [r55](https://github.com/leonardoalt/r55) MVP project, [notes](https://hackmd.io/@leoalt/r55) success and learned the whole prcocess of adding a new VM to evm chain.
* Research Monad, read the docs, learned the execution and consensus optimization Monad does.
* Benchmark between rust-evm and revm: [code](https://github.com/Akagi201/evm-workshop/blob/master/bench/benches/rust_evm.rs) revm first run slow, encountered [a weird behavior](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1dn99xi/very_weird_behaviour_when_doing_bench_testing/), will dig into it later.
