# Week 0

## Introduction

Hi EPFers, this is Bob Liu(Akagi201).

I have been working in Web3 area for many years. I am focused on Web3 infras and MEV/HFT trading.

## EPF Goal

There are many and increasing EVM chains, and they many have different roadmap and unique features. What I want to do is to decode the diff and benchmarks of different EVM execution clients. I think it's both valuable for Core developers and Application developers.

I want to do more deep researches on the ETH Execution Layer, and contribute to Reth/Revm's repo.

## Project Ideas

* EVM benchmark tool, op code and transaction level.
* EVM diff tool, use code to generate diffs of different EVM chains(focus on GO and Rust implementations)

## Weekly Updates

* Join Chinese EPF opening camp meeting, knowing the background and goals.
* Set up project ideas of the cohort 5 session.
* Do some researches on existing EVM execution layer testing tools.

## Plans

* Do some researches and tests on existing projects.
* Study <https://github.com/ethereum/benchmarking>
* Study <https://github.com/ipsilon/evm-benchmarks>
* Study <https://github.com/cassc/rust-evm-bench>
* Study <https://github.com/ziyadedher/evm-bench>
